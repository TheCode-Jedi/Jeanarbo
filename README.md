Personal portfolio site where I showcase my projects and skills for employers and clients to see. This was something built with an HTML5 template that was heavily modified to fit my specific needs. It uses a vairety of JS scripts to achieve the animations and certain effetcs. I used HTML5, SCSS and JavaScript for this project. This continues to be my portfolio and will be updated regurlaly.
